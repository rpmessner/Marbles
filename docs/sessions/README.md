# Development Sessions

This folder contains detailed documentation of each development session for Bidama Hajiki.

## Session Index

### [Session 006: Triangle Rendering](./006-triangle-rendering.md)
**Date:** 2025-12-04 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

Implemented a complete graphics pipeline to render a colored triangle - the classic "Hello World" of graphics programming.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ GLSL shaders (vertex + fragment)
- ✅ SPIR-V compilation with embedded loading
- ✅ Full graphics pipeline configuration
- ✅ Vertex buffer with triangle data
- ✅ Draw call in render loop
- ✅ Colored triangle on dark blue background

**Next Up:** Phase 4 - Transformations / Game Content

### [Session 005: Core Rendering](./005-core-rendering.md)
**Date:** 2025-12-04 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

Implemented the complete Vulkan rendering pipeline - from logical device creation to frame presentation. The window now clears to dark blue, proving the entire graphics pipeline works.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Logical device and queue creation
- ✅ Swap chain with double buffering
- ✅ Render pass and framebuffers
- ✅ Command pool, buffers, and sync objects
- ✅ Working render loop with frame synchronization
- ✅ Updated build.zig for Zig 0.15.2

**Next Up:** Phase 3 - Triangle Rendering

### [Session 004: Migration to Zig](./004-zig-migration.md)
**Date:** 2025-12-03 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

Major architectural pivot - switched from C++ to Zig. The project philosophy ("simple, direct code") aligned perfectly with Zig's design goals.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Migrated from C++ to Zig 0.13.0
- ✅ Replaced CMake/vcpkg/Makefiles with Zig build system (30 lines)
- ✅ Ported main.cpp to main.zig (~180 lines)
- ✅ Removed 500MB+ of build dependencies
- ✅ Updated all documentation for Zig

**Next Up:** Phase 2 - Core Rendering (clear screen to color)

### [Session 003: Rebranding and Priorities](./003-rebranding-and-priorities.md)
**Date:** 2025-11-22 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

Renamed project to Bidama Hajiki (ビー玉弾き), established "find the fun first" philosophy, and prepared comprehensive Phase 2 implementation guide.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Project rebranded from "Marbles" to Bidama Hajiki
- ✅ Decided on controller-first input design (PS2 gamepad)
- ✅ Clarified lighting and physics as essential for gameplay
- ✅ Cleaned legacy ODE references
- ✅ Created detailed Phase 2 rendering guide

**Next Up:** Language migration (Session 004)

### [Session 002: Cross-Platform Build System](./002-cross-platform-build-system.md)
**Date:** 2025-11-22 | **Status:** ✅ Complete (Superseded by Zig)

Established cross-platform build system with Windows cross-compilation from WSL2.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ MinGW-w64 cross-compilation working
- ✅ vcpkg managing Windows dependencies
- ✅ Platform-specific build scripts
- ✅ LSP integration with compile_commands.json

**Note:** This session's build system was replaced by Zig in Session 004.

### [Session 001: Resurrection and Foundation](./001-resurrection-and-foundation.md)
**Date:** 2025-11-22 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

Resurrected the old college project, archived the over-engineered OOP codebase, and started fresh with a modern Vulkan-based approach following Jonathan Blow's C-style programming philosophy.

**Key Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Archived museum codebase
- ✅ Created modern build system (Makefile + CMake)
- ✅ Minimal Vulkan initialization
- ✅ Project philosophy and roadmap established

**Next Up:** Cross-platform build system
